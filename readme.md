## üìñ Abstract
Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SR) aims to restore high-resolution images from low-resolution hyperspectral images. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in capturing global dependencies, Transformers excel in modeling long-range dependencies but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. In this paper, we propose HSRMamba, a State Space model-based SR network that balances computational efficiency (linear complexity) with effective global feature capture. HSRMamba reduces modal conflicts between high-frequency spatial features and low-frequency spectral features using wavelet decomposition. Additionally, we introduce a strip-based scanning scheme for Visual Mamba to minimize artifacts from global unidirectional scanning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSRMamba reduces computational load and model size while outperforming existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.
